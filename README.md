# Ground for designing GraphQL

* **This project is very early stage**, so:
* All humans are welcomed
* Good bots will be celebrated
* [Everyone can open an issue](https://github.com/graphqlstudio/ground/issues/new)
* [Everyone can edit wiki](https://github.com/graphqlstudio/ground/wiki)
* Somebody can take ownership if desired by majority (and I must agree of course :slightly_smiling_face:)
